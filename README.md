1 - About

HayDay is a 3d resource collection/management game based around the buying, selling  and farming of cows.

2 - Gameplay 

The gameplay is split up into two main areas; the mart, where cows can be bought and sold & the farm, where the cows are fed and maintained so that they can hopefully be sold at a higher price in the mart.

3 -Development

HayDay was developed by John Walsh and Fintan Williams using the unity game engine.

4 - Future Goals

We would like to add the ability to upgrade the farm and acquire more land to farm more cows.

Additionally we would like to increase the intractability of the bidders and other characters in the mart.
