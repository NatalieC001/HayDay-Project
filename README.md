# HayDay-Project

About
-----
HayDay is a 3D resource collection / management game based around the buying, selling  and farming of cattle. The player must develop their farm into a thriving business.
The game is still in early-alpha, expect buggy gameplay at the moment.

Gameplay
--------
The gameplay is split up into two main areas; the mart, where cows and supplies can be bought and sold & the farm, where the cows are fed and maintained so that they can hopefully be sold at a higher price in the mart.

Development
-----------
HayDay was developed by John Walsh and Fintan Williams using the unity game engine. Assets from multiple sources have been collected and implemented in-game, some resources have been developed & modified to the suit the game.

The main scripting language used to implement the gameplay & UI has been C#.

Future Goals
------------
Future goals to implement & experiment with, mainly gameplay features.

* We would like to add the ability to upgrade the farm and acquire more land to farm more cows.
* Additionally we would like to increase the intractability of the bidders and other characters in the mart.
