TO FINISH CONFIGURING THE EXPORTED XCODE PROJECT

1. Add these frameworks:

      AddressBook.framework
      AssetsLibrary.framework
      CoreData.framework
      CoreTelephony.framework
      CoreText.framework
      Security.framework
      libc++.dylib
      libz.dylib

2. Add the following bundles and frameworks from the Google Plus
   and the Google Play Games C++ SDKs. These can be downloaded from
   https://developers.google.com/games/services.

      GoogleOpenSource.framework
      GoogleSignId.bundle
      GoogleSignId.framework
      gpg.bundle
      gpg.framework

   Note: Make sure the bundles are copied to application.  This can be
    verified under Build Phases/Copy Bundle Resources.

3. Add the '-ObjC' linker flag. To do this, select the top-level project
   object, select the 'Unity-iPhone' build target, then go to the
   Build Settings tab. Search for Other Linker Flags and add
   the '-ObjC' flag to that list.

** Note: To run in the simulator, use Unity 4.6.8 or greater.
