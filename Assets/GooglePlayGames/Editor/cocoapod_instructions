TO FINISH CONFIGURING THE EXPORTED XCODE PROJECT

The xcode project has been updated using CocoaPods.
(See http://cocoapods.org for more information).


In order to build the project, you must close XCode
and open the project using the xcWorkspace file to build.


Your project is now ready to build and deploy!


** Note:  To run on the iOS simulator use Unity 4.6.8 or greater.
