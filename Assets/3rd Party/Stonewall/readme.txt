Dry stone wall with leafy vine:

All assets created by Barbara Parkman, for use in Unity3D engine.

The dry stone wall consists of 3 modular sections, small, medium and large.  Each section is available either with a leafy vine covering or plain.  Just drag the prefab you want into your project.  Hint:  The small and medium sections are great for tight curves and steep hills.  Also, the small section has vines on the end as well as the two sides for use as an end piece.  

The leafy vine is an optional transparent cover with leaf images applied. Photoshop files with UV maps are included in case you want to make your own vine textures.
